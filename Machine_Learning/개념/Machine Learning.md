## Machine Learning

Limitation of explicit programming
- Spam filter: many rules
- Automatic driving: too many rules

Machine Learning: "Field of study that gives computer the ability to learn without being
explicitly programmed" Arthur Samuel(1959)

Supervised learning
- learning with labeled examples -> training set
ex. An example training set for visual categories. -> cat, dog, mug, hat...

Unsupervised learning -> un-labeled data
- Google news grouping
- Word clustering

Most common problem type in ML
- Image labeling: learning from tagged images
- Email spam filter: learning from labeled(spam or ham) email
- Predicting exam score: learning from previous exam score and time spent

Training data set

AlphaGo -> supervised learning
training data set

Types of supervised learning
- Predicting final exam score based on time spent -> 1. regression
- Pass/non-pass based on time spent -> 2. binary classification
- Letter grade(A,B,C,D and F) based on time spent -> 3. multi-label classification

-> choose which type of learning I need
